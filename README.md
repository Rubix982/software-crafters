This is a community for those who care and are proud of what they do. For those developers, regardless how experienced they are, who want to improve and master their craft.

# Who are we?
We are an open community of people learning to write & deliver better software. We believe learning together and helping each other is the fastest way to grow.

# Who can join?
Everyone involved in any stage of the softwares lifecycle: customers, developers, mentors/coaches...

**We encourage diversity:** great software can only be delivered with close collaboration of everyone involved at all stages of software development.

**We encourage people of all levels of experience to join:** students to professionals, and everyone in between.

# What will I learn?
We learn about topics such as:

- Clean Code
- Test-Driven Development
- Design Principles
- Pair Programming
- Continuous Delivery

And much more!

We also like doing *katas*â€¦

# What are Katas?
Katas are a form of learning by practice. Katas allow us to experiment practices and techniques in a safe environment, so that we can later use them in the real-world.

We usually do our katas in pairs (or groups). Pair programming maximizes knowledge sharing, focus and quality of work. You can find more kata best practices & pair programming in our [Kata Guide](/kata-guide).
