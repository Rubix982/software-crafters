# What is Software Craftsmenship?

`Software Craftsmenship` is an important part of a software life cycle that deals with refining, fixin, and simplifying code, already developed code bases, with the intent to keep the end result the same for the user base, but easier to build up and easier to read and understand for future developers and maintainers.

`Software Craftsmenship` can be described by talking about *Design Principles*, *Agile / Scrum Workflows*, *Test Driven Development*, and focusing on *clean*, *modularized* code, with emphasis on *Pair / Extreme Programming*.

The ideas discussed here are inspired by *Kent Beck*, and *Martin Flower*, with their book ***Refactoring***.

## So, in short, what is this community?

> This is a community for those who care and are proud of what they do. For those, regardless how experienced they are, who want to improve and master their craft.

# Who are we?

We are an open community of people learning to write & deliver better software. We believe learning together and helping each other is the fastest way to grow. The people in this community range from student novices, to people working full time jobs just trying to better their practices as a software engineer.

# Who can join?

This community wants to serve as a platform where people can get together for the sake of achieving the goals described above. But in essence, everyone involved in any stage of the software developement lifecycle, or anyone seeking to better understand the process. This means,
    * Customers
    * Developers
    * Mentors
    * Coaches
And so on.

### We encourage diversity

Great software can only be delivered with close collaboration of everyone involved at all stages of software development.

### We encourage people of all levels of experience to join

Students to professionals, and everyone in between.

# How can I join?
Join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/570463523588860), and you are in!

The next step is to join us in one of our **meet-ups**. Watch out for meet-ups on our Facebook page.

# What will I learn?
We learn about topics such as:

- Clean Code
- Test-Driven Development
- Design Principles
- Refactoring
- Pair Programming
- Continuous Delivery

and much more!

We also like doing ***katas***â€¦

# What are Katas?
Katas are a form of learning by practice. Katas allow us to experiment practices and techniques in a safe environment, so that we can later use them in the real-world.

We usually do our katas in pairs (or groups). Pair programming maximizes knowledge sharing, focus and quality of work. You can find more kata best practices & pair programming in our [Kata Guide](/2020-05-26-kata-guide.md).
