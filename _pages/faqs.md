# Some FAQs

-----------

Q): What is the purpose of this group?
A): It's to serve as a place where people can come and discuss ideas about software. *Extreme / Pair Programming* believes that people work best and understand the ways of their design better when they have someone who they can explain it to, and when someone else is trying to understand the thoughts of the person writing the code.

So, in essence, it's to provide a platform which developers can used to talk about what writing *good code* really is, and how the modern tech industry expects new graduate to think about code.

-----------

Q): How can I *benefit* from this group as a senior in University?
A): Soon after graduation and after you get your first job, you realize the the workflow of code might not have been what you were used to in University - developing makeshift projects with hackish code. *Software Crafters* gives you a good insight into how modern practices play a huge role in developing, deploying, and putting into production quality code.

-----------

Q): How can I *use* this group as senior or less?
A): The more you do something, the more you gradually tend to thnk in that direction. Using this as an example, taking a look into how the industry thinks and works might be an eye opener about common code and development problems that you might face in your semesters when you try to code something out.
